The *Specialized Combat Assault Reserve* does not exist, officially speaking. 

You will not find it in SEAF’s Records, you will not find them on patriotic posters to inspire the masses to do their part, and you will never see the names of their roster among the Hall of Heroes. 
That is because according to SEAF and all of Super Earth’s Administration every member of *S.C.A.R.* are divers turned criminals, not traitors, but driven to dishonor through them facing the horrors of war and finding only horror can be the response. 
This conclusion, though admirable, leads them to be seen as “Unconventional, insubordinate wretches” and “Caring little for the lives of Super Earth’s citizens let alone their own”. 
These accusations are all true, and they’ll tell you as such should you have the misfortune of meeting one of their misbegotten number. 

For Super Earth as a whole however, this damages the image of Helldivers abroad and at home, and thus High Command has had them defunded, arrested, tried for treason among other crimes, and executed justly. 

Unfortunately for the Automatons, only the first of those listed is true.
