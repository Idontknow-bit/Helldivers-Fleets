## Lore
**Per Aspera Ad Astra**

By 2166, the Theseus sector, which consisted of six planets orbiting a red supergiant, had been mostly conquered by the automatons. The sixth planet from the star, a scarred and barren world called Tien Kwan, was still under ASEF (Allied Super-Earth Forces) control but was under siege by the automatons from the east, and was in danger of falling into their hands at any moment. Tien Kwan was vital to ASEF because of the high quantity of ruthenium ore in its crust, a normally exceedingly rare metal which was essential in the manufacturing of ASEF’s newest weapon in the automaton war – an advanced and versatile mech known as the EXO-45 Patriot. The Patriot was equipped with every manner of weapon, could survive in any environment, and, since it was manned by humans, could not be hacked and repurposed by the automatons. There was one problem, however – each mech required large amounts of ruthenium for its complex electrical components and superalloy hull plating, and this rare ore was found only in large quantities on one known planet: Tien Kwan. The planet, its vast factory complexes manufacturing the EXO-45s, and the technology itself could not fall under automaton control or humanity’s chances of winning the decades-long war would decline catastrophically.

The ASEF forces defending Tien Kwan fought desperately to protect the planet, but they were outnumbered and running low on resources due to the siege. As a last-ditch effort to save Tien Kwan, ASEF decided to perform a complex military procedure. They unloaded all their remaining planet side firepower in a matter of days, prompting a fierce counterattack and luring in a significant percentage of the automaton forces in the Theseus sector. They then feigned a retreat, falling back into defensive bunkers as the automatons occupied the planet, believing they had won. Finally, super earth troops named “Helldivers” were deployed from orbit out of ships that had snuck into the sector using experimental cloaking technology. They were followed by space-to-ground fighters and general infantry as well as mech pilots who activated the EXO-45s as the factories were retaken and used them to continue the battle.

The losses were staggering. Virtually all the Helldivers and a significant portion of the infantry, EXO-45s, and carrier ships were killed or destroyed. However, ASEF had reclaimed Tien Kwan and dealt a devastating blow to automaton forces in the Theseus Sector, which would lay the path for the reclamation of the entire system. The valor and sacrifice of the legendary Helldivers in Tien Kwan would echo into eternity.

Also legendary were the EXO-45 pilots and engineers which had been instrumental in reclaiming the planet. They were skilled, intelligent operators which used finesse and precision in combination with the incredible firepower of the EXO-45s to inflict devastating damage against enemy forces. After Tien Kwan’s liberation, the pilots noticed that the only surviving life on the blackened soil of the battlefields was the unguepods, highly-resilient invertebrates which closely resembled Earth scorpions. Thus, the EXO-45 forces became known as the Tien Kwan Scorpions, ASEF’s glorious spear against their chrome usurpers. When a battalion of scorpions marched against the enemy, their footfalls rumbled like a stampede and their guns blazed with the light of a thousand suns. It is said that the sight struck fear even into the cold, metal heart of an automaton.
