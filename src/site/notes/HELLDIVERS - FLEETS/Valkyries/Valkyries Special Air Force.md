## Lore

_When all else fails, look up_ 

Welcome to the Air Force Helldiver!

_VSAF Is our Battalion for Designated Pilot Divers. For Valkyries who prefer the wind in their visor to mud on their boots. Of course spilling oil remains our primary objective. Operating closely with The Forgotten Sons; VSAF aims to engage targets from above._ **OUR GOAL** _The pursuit of VSAF is to add to the growing war effort of Valkyrie specialised infantry Battalions with 360 degree precision. Practical and adept_ **Jump Pack** _usage is a desired characteristic to become a VSAF Pilot. Primarily VSAF pilots operate Eagle Stratagem Tactical Resources to ensure_ **YOU** _get your payload on time!_ 

Be it: Raining hell from above, Tactically changing position, Evacuating on time safely and most importantly,

_Looking badass while doing so_ _Sheepskins and Aviators are a must and will be supplied on request._ 

“_Eagle ONE heading in to resupply._”
