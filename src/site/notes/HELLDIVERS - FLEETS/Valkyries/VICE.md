## Lore
`You are not here because you are the strongest, or the fastest, or the luckiest. You are here because you failed Super Earth. Really, you failed yourself. But we offer a road to redemption - your penitent journey has begun.` 

`You are now one of my daemons, my wretches. Your armour sealed around you, you will carry your prison with you. This is not a pardon for your crimes, nor is it salvation. These must be earned in the fires of Hell. With great effort - great will, your actions will be forgiven.` 

`Hell awaits, daemon - now get ready to dive.`
