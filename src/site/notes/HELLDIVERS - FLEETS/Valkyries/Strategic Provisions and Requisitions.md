## Lore
As the Spear Strategic Provisions and Requisitions (SPR) battalion under the Vandalon Valkyries, our mission is dual-edged. We ensure frontline readiness through superior logistical support, directly impacting combat success. Our expertise in rapid provisioning and strategic requisitions equips the Valkyries for any engagement, maintaining operational superiority. 

Parallel to our logistical prowess, we wield visual media as a strategic tool to fortify morale. We craft compelling visual narratives that celebrate valor, foster unity, and uplift spirits across the ranks and civilian fronts. Through powerful imagery and stories, we bolster the warrior spirit and communal resilience. 

At our core, we are the spearheadâ€”driving forward with precision and purpose, arming our troops and igniting the heart of our force. Excellence in provision, dominance in spirit.
