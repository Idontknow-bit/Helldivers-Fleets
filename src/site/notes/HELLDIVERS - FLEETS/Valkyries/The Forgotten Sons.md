## Lore
We are sworn to Lady Liberty, and her unwavering, guiding gaze met upon every planet in every sector. The smoke and ash—ruin and tarnation from the machines and insectoids. There is a ravenous campaign against all that is good, clean, and free. A campaign headed against families of the free sector, against families devout to our Lady, against the family of your own. 

The Forgotten Sons appear as Lady Liberty's silent but devastating enforcers. We are masters of shock and awe tactics, excelling at swift, covert operations that instill fear in the enemy. We carry out missions with the precision of our aim and the force of a lightning bolt from Mjolnir. We are the iron-willed shock troopers, the Valkyries' blazing swords and crushing fists. 

They shall be the finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to Lady Liberty. Like clay Lady Liberty shall mould them and in the furnaces of Vandalon Lady Liberty shall forge them. They shall be of iron will and steely sinew. In great armour Lady Liberty shall clad them and with the mightiest weapons shall they be armed. They shall have such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe will best them in battle. They are Lady Liberty’s bulwark against the Terror. They are the sword and shield of our Lady, against all who dare oppose her indivisibility, freedom, and blind justice.

> "_Heralds of the coming doom, by cry of raven, we are drawn. This oath of war and vengeance, on blade of exalted iron sworn. With blood-anointed swords aloft, advance we into dread's dark shade. Punishment divine unleashed with hate, a wrathful storm of bolt and blade. Purge with ice, fist and shell, bring cleansing fire's righteous cold-drawn breath. For Vandalon, Valkyries, the Forgotten Sons: Angels of Death! No forgiveness, no retreat._"
