## Lore:
### The Origins

The Hexcellium Battalion (H.B.) was in dire need of a specialised Anti-tank company and so the captain in charge ordered the creation of a company capable of taking down the most armoured enemy units.  
the 88th anti-tank company (88th A.T.C.) was born.  
At the company Commander’s request the company’s name was to commemorate the well known and effective 88mm anti tank projectile used in the old world wars.  
The company lives by its motto, which perfectly represents the company’s supportive fighting style, they won’t give up until the very end.

### The Kampfzwergs

The 88th A.T.C. is used to being dwarfed by the enemies they pick a fight with.  
This is where they found their codename, “Kampfzwergs”.  
It directly translates to battle dwarfs, a fitting name for helldivers fighting the heaviest of enemies on the battlefield.**
