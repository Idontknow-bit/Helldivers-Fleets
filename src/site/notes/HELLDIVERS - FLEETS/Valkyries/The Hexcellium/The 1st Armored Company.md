## Lore

### The Origins

The 1st Armored Company (1sr A.C.), Codename “AEGIS”, was born the same day as the Hexcellium Battalion (H.B.) at the battalion’s captain request.  
Don’t be fooled by this Company's codename, it may sound like this Company's goal is only to protect the H.B. but in reality they are a fearless and bloodthirsty Company.  
“Qui non timet, vincit.” - he who does not fear, wins; More than a motto, this is the Company’s creed.

### The Aegis

The battalion captain’s led a disinformation campaign inspired by an old war tactic.

The 1st A.C. is the spearhead of the H.B., calling it “AEGIS” was a ruse to cover it as a defence oriented division incapable of leading assaults.

The real meaning of the division’s codename comes from an old saying from the times of swords and shields:  
After going to war, Coming back home with a shield meant that you had won the battle, coming back home without a shield meant that you had fled the battlefield and coming back upon your shield meant that you thought to the death.
