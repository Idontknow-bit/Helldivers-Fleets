## Lore

# The Origins

The 7th Expeditionary Company (7th E.C.) is all about rapid deployment into heavily contested areas. Before the main body of the battalion’s forces arrives, the 7th E.C. is there first to pave the way. Whether their mission consists of reinforcing planets under attack or being the first boots on enemy territory.

The Helldivers of the 7th rely on their speed and accuracy to hit the enemy where it hurts the most before slipping back into the mist, leaving nothing but heaps of scrap behind them on a planet ready to be liberated.

# The Phoenix

When Hellpods are deployed, they produce streaks of flames which could remind of Super Earth Ancient mythology’s immortal bird, the phoenix.  
As the first Helldivers to deploy in most theatres, the 7th E.C. is known as the first glint of hope, a hope reborn just like the phoenix rising from the ashes.
