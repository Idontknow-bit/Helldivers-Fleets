### The Origins

The 5th Reinforcement company (5th R.C.), codename “Kraken”, traces back to the tumultuous era following the catastrophic global conflict known as the great war.

The aftermath left the world fractured and vulnerable, teetering on the brink of chaos and tyranny.

As nations struggled to rebuild, trying to re-establish order and stability, a coalition of democratic powers emerged. United by freedom, justice and the defense of their democratic ideals the coalition thrived, giving birth to some of the most elite units of its time.

Among them stood a courageous unit known as “The Stallions of Democracy”, they were part of the vanguard and would later become the 5th R.C. after the loss of countless of their best helldivers during the automaton’s assault on Vandalon IV.

### The Kraken

The “Kraken”, a mythical sea monster of immense power and unfathomable size lurking beneath the surface and striking fear into the hearts of sailors for generations. This is a perfect representation of the ethos of the company, just as legendary Kraken was said to emerge from the depths to claim its prey and so did the helldivers of the stallions of democracy, rising from the shadows to confront the enemies of freedom and democracy wherever they may lurk.
