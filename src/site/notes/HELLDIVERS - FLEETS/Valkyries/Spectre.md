# Lore
In 2175, amidst the tumultuous tides of conflict, an unconventional unit emerged within the ranks of the Vandalon Armed Assault Corps—the SPECTRE Corp. 

Composed of outcasts, misfits, and individuals whose skills defied conventional norms, SPECTRE was forged in the crucible of necessity, born to tackle missions deemed too hazardous or unorthodox for traditional recon squads. 
Led by the enigmatic Captain Birb, SPECTRE operated on the fringes of conventional warfare, their unorthodox methods and unyielding resolve making them a force to be reckoned with. 
Handpicked by Birb herself, SPECTRE's members were a motley crew, each with their own quirks and specialties, but united by a common purpose—to excel where others faltered, to thrive where others feared to tread, in the name of Lady Liberty. 

On the war-torn fields beyond the galactic map, SPECTRE waged a relentless battle against the mechanical hordes of the Automatons. 
With their stealth and infiltration tactics, they struck from the shadows, gathering crucial intel and disrupting enemy operations with ruthless efficiency. 
Their successes, though unorthodox, earned them a reputation as the VAAC’s' most formidable asset in the fight against the relentless tide of war. 
Armed with gear inspired by their penchant for stealth and infiltration, SPECTRE's operatives navigated the treacherous terrain of enemy territory with ease, their advanced technology and unorthodox tactics setting them apart from their more conventional counterparts. 
From silent weaponry to cutting-edge camouflage systems, SPECTRE's arsenal was as unique and diverse as the individuals who wielded it.

As the years passed and the silent war raged on, SPECTRE's legacy grew, their exploits becoming the stuff of legend among the VAAC and beyond. 
Not trained, but chosen—SPECTRE's members were the embodiment of stealth, adaptability, and quiet determination in the face of enemy pressure. 
And though their methods may have been unconventional, their impact on the war effort was undeniable, earning members a place in the helldivers. 

In 2183, the SPECTRE’s were officially made part of the Vandalon Valkyries!
