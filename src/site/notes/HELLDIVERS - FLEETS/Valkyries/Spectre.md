In 2174 Vandalon came into contact with the automatons. The Vandalonian Leadership reached out, curious to see such advanced life-forms and hoped to establish peace. But peace was never an option. A Great War broke out, thousands of Valkyries answered the call to protect our home, yet thousands more perished. In these grave times, an unconventional unit was born within the Valkyries, the SPECTRE’s. The SPECTRE’s were outcasts, misfits, individuals whose gifts were deemed unconventional for a military unit. These SPECTRE’s were born in the fires of necessity, born to take on the missions deemed impossible, or too unorthodox for traditional reconnaissance forces to ever accomplish. Created and led by the enigmatic Marshal Birb, SPECTRE operated as an elite task force with their unorthodox methods, unyielding resolve and their undying passion for their leader and for Vandalon, making them a force to be reckoned with within the Valkyries. 

The SPECTRE’s were handpicked by Marshal Birb herself, a talented and diverse group of individuals with their own specialties and quirks who vowed to serve one purpose - to excel where others failed, to dare when others faltered, for the name of Lady Liberty, and for their Marshal. 

Amidst the bloody battlefield on Vandalon IV, the SPECTRE’s were at the forefront of every battle against the merciless automaton regime. They struck in the shadows, gathering crucial intel needed to give the Valkyries an edge in every battle, disrupting enemy transports, and intercepting enemy communications with ruthless efficiency. Their successes earned them the reputation as the Valkyrie's most formidable and dependable asset in the war against the mechanical hordes. With their armory and tactics aimed towards stealth and infiltration such as silence weaponry and camouflage systems, SPECTRE Agents traversed through the battlefield with grace and silence, setting them apart from the other battalions. 

As war raged on, the triumphs of SPECTRE’s grew, their names whispered as demigods in the field of battle amongst their fellow Valkyries. They are the epitome of resilience, adaptability, and unyielding determination in the face of adversity. Their efforts in the war was undeniable, their names forever forged into the halls of Valhalla as they spread managed democracy to the outermost parts of the universe
