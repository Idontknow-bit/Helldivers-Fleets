### Chaplains of Unyielding Liberty and Theology

_Chaplain Divers rely on Holy Fire_ (incendiary weapons, flamethrowers) _to purge heresy from Her galaxy, and call upon her Eagles, Freedom and Justice, to aid them in combat. Outside of battle, we work to translate her teachings from ancient texts and spread Her Will to our fellow Valkyries!_

**OUR GOAL** My friends, we are nothing, and we are capable of nothing, without the firm, loving grasp of Lady Liberty. It is only by her grace that we succeed, and it will be with her blessing that we strike down her greatest foes. 

Join me, Divers, in spreading Our Lady’s message throughout the cosmos. Deliver her divine justice to the clankers with her holy railgun, purge the heresy of those monstrous bugs with Eagle fire… Worship her name and her word, and be truly free!
