## Lore

_The steel smashing steel, the oil spilling oil_ 

Do you like mechs? I love mechs. 

Rending steel in unison with our mighty mechs, we press our advance one step at a time. We are the unstoppable force and the immovable object. We are the bastion of steel and gunpowder that stands tall while the battlefield crashes around us. We are the bulwark that grants our allies reprieve. We are the shining beacon which mocks our enemy. We are the machine which machines fear. We are MIST.

MIST is the mechanized division of the Vandalon Valkyries, and rarely deploys as full squads. Our sworn duty is to ride our valiant mechs into battle and be that which our squad requires. Whether we're distraction or vanguard, bunker or rearguard, MIST will do what we must to serve our squad to the fullest of our abilities. MIST also plays a major hand in the development of tactics regarding the usage of mechs in extreme cold environments, and at times lends aid in developing mech tactics in other extreme environments. MIST's out-of-combat responsibilities include overseeing the maintenance and repair of Valkyrie mechs and other vehicle and vehicle-adjacent equipment. Our mascot is Blend-o, the blender that walks; he is not an automaton, he is a robot.
