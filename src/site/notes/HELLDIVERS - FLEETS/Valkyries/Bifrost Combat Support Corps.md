## Lore
We were there at the Battle of High Hill, when the first incursion happened. 

We were there at the Deagle Defensive, when the SEAF came to our aid. 

We were there at the Battle of the Bridge, when the end came. 

_I founded the Bifrost in the ruin of the Vandalon Armed Reserve, but I wore the burden of those battles in shame, knowing all that we had lost. In defense of Vandalon, I lost an arm and an eye, but I would do it all again to protect our noble home._ 

I do not mind your origin, I do not mind your personal creed. 

_So long as you bleed ice and fight to stand up for all that the Bifrost did to those that were lost, you have a place here with us._ 

Bifrost Bridge was a path to freedom, prosperity, safety, and liberty. It gave hope to all who crossed, and all those that died in the pursuit of freedom to get there. 

_We **will** do the same._
