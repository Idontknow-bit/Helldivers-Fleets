## Lore
After the First Galactic War, Super Earth dedicated itself into populating the surrounding systems into the fold after pushing back the cyborgs, terminids, and illuminates to the edge. 
The Cyborgs were introduced into the fold as slaves for going against the Managed Democracy of Super Earth. 
Terminids were exterminated from the face of the galaxy and the Illuminate were exterminated from the galaxy, and as such, Super Earth appropriated some of the technology the Illuminate used to develop FTL jump and to further extend the strength and power of the Democracy and Freedom of Super Earth. 

15 years later, the Helldiver division in charge of Durgen retired and settled on Durgen after an extensive campaign in taking the planet and liberating it from the hands of the Cyborgs. 
As time went on, those veterans fostered a community of Helldivers and family around the capital of Vanguard. Vanguard and the surrounding community flourished under the Managed Democracy of Super Earth. 
However, in the process of terraforming Durgen, the settlers awakened the underground fauna of the planet, primarily the giant Sandworms that live to surf the dunes of Durgen. 

These colossal beasts, capable of burrowing through the planet's rocky crust with ease, posed a significant danger to both Helldivers and settlers alike. 
Their massive size, ferocious nature, and ability to strike without warning made them formidable adversaries. 
As such, the Durgen divisions of Helldivers living on the planet retook their armors and weapons, and went undertook the massive undertaking of liberating the planet of the threat of the Sandworms.
One particular incident, known as the Battle of the Sand Dunes, would forever shape the identity of the Helldivers division on Durgen. 
In a desperate bid to protect a vital mining outpost from a massive sandworm incursion, the Helldivers fought bravely against overwhelming odds. 
Despite their valiant efforts, casualties were heavy, and victory seemed uncertain. It was during this harrowing battle that a small squad of Helldivers discovered a crucial weakness in the sandworms' armor: their vulnerable underbelly. 
The process in which this was done, many helldivers lost their lives to the cause of Super Earth and the liberation of Vanguard and Durgen. 

As the battle raged on amidst the shifting sands of Durgen's dunes, a small squad of Helldivers found themselves cornered by a massive sandworm. 
With their ammunition running low and their defenses strained, the squad's leader, Captain Rhyder, knew they needed to find a way to turn the tide of the battle. 
As the sandworm lunged forward, its massive jaws snapping dangerously close, one of the Helldivers noticed something unusual: a brief glimpse of the creature's underbelly exposed as it breached the surface of the sand. 
Recognizing this momentary vulnerability, Captain Rhyder ordered his squad to focus their fire on the exposed area. 

An intense battle waged in the dunes, where both human and worms fought for control of the surface of the planet. 
The discovery of the sandworms' vulnerability proved to be a turning point in the battle. 
Armed with this newfound knowledge, the Helldivers rallied their forces, coordinating attacks against the sandworms with precision and determination. 
Slowly but surely, they began to gain ground, driving the creatures back and securing the outpost from further harm.
In the aftermath of the battle, the Helldivers' discovery would not only save countless lives but also pave the way for future encounters with the sandworms. 
With their newfound understanding of the creatures' weakness, the Durgen Helldiver's Division would continue to defend the planet with unwavering resolve, ensuring that the legacy of their bravery and ingenuity endured for generations to come.

They would later become known as the Durgen Sandworms, taking their foes intense strength and stealth, their unbreakable will and their difficult to find chink in their armor.
