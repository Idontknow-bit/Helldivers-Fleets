Subject: Arrival of mech pilot, Sentinel Atlas of the Tien Kwan Scorpions 

Classification: TOP SECRET. 

To: Super Earth Vanguard Command 
From: Institute of Tien Kwan 

Date: [Classified] 

Cipher: Victor-Zulu-Omega 
Authentication: Echelon-7 

Helldiver, 
You are being briefed on Operation Smoke Jaguar, involving the highly classified pilot known as Atlas within the Tien Kwan Scorpions unit. 

Atlas is a critical asset to our covert operations, wielding unparalleled skill in piloting the Patriot Mech platform. His performance in field tests has exceeded expectations, demonstrating a keen tactical mind and lethal precision in engagements against rival factions. 

Under the guise of routine maneuvers, Atlas is being deployed to strategic hotspots across the sector, gathering vital intelligence and neutralizing high-value targets. His missions are of utmost importance to Tien Kwan's agenda, and failure is not an option.

It is imperative that Atlas's identity remains concealed at all costs. Compromising his cover would not only jeopardize Operation Smoke Jaguar but also expose Tien Kwan's covert operations network to our adversaries. 

Handle this information with extreme caution, and ensure that only trusted operatives within your circle are briefed accordingly. Any breach in security will be met with severe consequences. 

Proceed with vigilance and discretion. 

~ With armored might, and venomous grace, we move as one.
