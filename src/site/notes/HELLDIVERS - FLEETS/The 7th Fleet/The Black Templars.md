## Lore
In the darkness of Malevelon Creek, where mettle is tested and veterans were born. This is where the Templars were born. But not where they remained. Amongst the blood shed and men lost there was but one who stood alone in the darkness. His troops dead, but morale unwavering. Revenant. Realizing the forces of SEAF were disorganized, under-equipped, and under-manned. But that could all be changed, and it was, with the birth of the greatest fighting force the galaxy had seen in Sol Cycles. 

**The Black Templars.** The Black Templars were forged in the blood bath and flames of Malevelon Creek. But they were not blinded by the hate for the automatons, their fury was tempered and wrathful. And they bore but one tenant, **Extraction is Optional, Abhor Super Earth's Enemies.** There was no halting their advance once they were set on the planet. With High Marshal Revenant at the helm, and his loyal Marshal's at his side, the Black Templars led their grand Crusade-Fleet through the known galaxy to any planet in need of liberation. But their wrath was not bound to the forces on the ground. For in times of need, when a planet's destruction was valued more than anything else, the _**Exterminatus Protocol**_ was always there as a failsafe. The first and to date only usage of this weapon was conducted by **[Redacted]** . The ranks of the Templars are full and righteous, and ever-growing.

**The Black Templar:** We are bound by a single cause, cleanse heretic filth. Our weapons chained to us, a promise to never surrender, to never back away from a fight. 
Once we raise our weapons high they do not rest until our blasphemous foe is dead. No prisoner, no surrender, no mercy. This is our creed. 
Our shadowed armor protects us from view, our faith protects us from harm.
