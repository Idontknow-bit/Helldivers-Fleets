## Lore
Welcome to The 82nd Battalion, nicknamed “The Jäger Bombs”. 
We Jagers focus on the COMPLETE Obliteration of ALL of Super Earths enemies. Be it the Green Blooded Mosquitoes to the east, or the Oil Filled Socialist to the west. 
We eradicate every know nest, base, or sign of the enemy until the people of the planet forget they were even there.
Eagle and Orbital strikes serve us and our purpose! 
We were made to eradicate any and all of traces of the enemy. We focus on the FULL liberation of the section we are assaulting, meaning no nest or base will be left standing by the time we extract.
Be it hell or high water, we will see our enemy’s forgotten to history as the losers of this Great War!
For those interested on the history of our great Brigade, we are not the first Jäger Bombs to appear.
In the first galactic war 100 years ago, our forefathers fought back the enemy until we prevailed.
Our Brigade was there when the Illumates fell to extinction. 
We've been summoned once again to obliterate the alien threat. We started as a three man squad, and expanded quickly from their. 
Remember Divers, We Dive so Democracy can Fly!

"Anhilation we bring upon enemies of Democracy!"
