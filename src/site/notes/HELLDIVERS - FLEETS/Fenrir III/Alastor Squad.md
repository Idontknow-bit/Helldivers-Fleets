***ARES SQUADRON FILES. ENTRY 01..***

`Ares Squadron was among the initial Helldivers engaged on Fenrir III. They decisively dismantled the Initial Terminid defense through a combination of superior firepower and adept use of napalm, enabling the establishment of a crucial foothold beyond the landing zone.

`Despite their continuous frontline presence throughout the Liberation, their skilled JTACs managed to keep fratricide rates below 28%. Since settling on their new home world, Ares Squadron has been actively involved in supporting various operations and remains dedicated to eliminating the Terminid threat from the galaxy once and for all.`
