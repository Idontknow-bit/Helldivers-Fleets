## Lore:
The Wolf Pack regiment is a highly specialized unit renowned for its expertise in stealth and covert operations. Comprised of three distinct squadrons - Ares, Bravo, and Chiron - the regiment operates with ruthless efficiency in the shadows of conflict zones.

Squadron Ares, named after the Greek god of war, serves as the vanguard of the Wolf Pack, specializing in reconnaissance and infiltration. Their operatives are trained to slip undetected behind enemy lines, gathering vital intelligence and paving the way for subsequent operations.

Squadron Bravo, named for its bold and decisive actions, excels in direct action missions. Whether conducting surgical strikes or sabotage operations, Bravo squadron operatives are equipped with advanced weaponry, heavy ordinance and tactics to swiftly neutralize high-value targets with minimal collateral damage.

Chiron squadron, named after the wise and skilled centaur of Greek mythology, is the Wolf Pack's specialist unit in battlefield medical care and support. Drawing from a diverse range of skills, Chiron operatives excel planet side recovery, care under fire, emergency extraction, psychological care, and building alliances with local populations to achieve their objectives.

Operating under the cloak of darkness, the Wolf Pack Helldivers strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, leaving no trace behind as they execute their missions with precision and cunning. Their reputation as masters of stealth and covert operations makes them a formidable force on the battlefield, capable of turning the tide of war in their favour.
