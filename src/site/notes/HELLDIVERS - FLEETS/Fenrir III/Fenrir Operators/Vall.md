Rank: Fenrir III Commander, Death Captain

Age: 26

Homeworld: Fenrir III

Affiliation: Wolf Pack

Vall was raised on his parents' moisture farm, where he assisted them tirelessly. As a teenager, he apprenticed as a construction worker, contributing to the establishment of vital structures to accommodate the arrival of new settlers from Super Earth and neighbouring planets.

In his early twenties, the Terminids emerged, plunging life on Fenrir III into turmoil. Those unable to defend themselves fell swiftly, while the capable faced the grim choice of defending their homes or seeking refuge on other planets. Vall's parents opted for evacuation and found safety on Mars, but Vall remained determined to protect his beloved Fenrir III.

Despite a year of relentless combat with minimal support from Super Earth's defence forces, a team of Helldivers arrived on the planet, appearing almost superhuman in their prowess. Vall witnessed their awe-inspiring battle against the Terminid horde, until the formidable Bile Titan emerged.

In a harrowing skirmish on the outskirts of his ravaged village, Vall's home was struck by a Terminid bile projectile. Pulled from the rubble and armed with a pistol by a Helldiver, Vall joined the squad in a desperate struggle for survival. After hours of relentless combat, the Terminids were temporarily repelled.

Following the battle, Vall learned that reinforcements were inbound. As the Helldivers moved toward the evacuation point, Vall found himself alone amidst the ruins of his home, until the squad leader approached him.

"Come with me, son."

Guided back to the rest of the squad, Vall was introduced and briefed on recent events as they made their way to evacuation. Upon arrival, with the shuttle awaiting them and new Helldiver forces on the ground, the squad leader extended an invitation to Vall to join the Helldivers Training Academy on Super Earth. Gazing back at his devastated home, Vall silently vowed to one day return and free his homeland. 

Boarding the shuttle marked the beginning of Vall's extraordinary journey.
