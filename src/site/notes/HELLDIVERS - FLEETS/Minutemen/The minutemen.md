## Lore
Any time the call is made for the safety of our way of life and the lives of Liberty's precious citizens, the Minutemen are known to be quick and decisive, with their blazing Railguns and Eagle strikes clearing a path through all foes!

  

When raided by the vicious oil-fueled commie Automatons, the hardy of Mantes stood up and defended their liberty and democracy! Veterans who fought alongside those of Mantes, and those across the galaxy who were inspired by their indomitable spirit, have since joined our ranks in defending our home planets! For every harsh push from the Automatons, the Minutemen push back with twice as much force, allowing their continuous assault against Lady Liberty’s harshest opponents to speak more for them than any words could.

  

Despite being solely created by those born and raised on Mantes, the Minutemen are a decentralized faction of Divers from all walks of life, inclusive to every gun raised in the defense of Super Earth and her many colonies. 

  

The Mantes Minutemen are dedicated Sentinels for all of Super Earth’s colonies and citizens! We stand always ready, willing, and prepared to dominate any force that may try to threaten the friends, families, and loved ones that each and every citizen and Diver holds dear.

We are Liberty. 

We are Democracy.

We are Freedom.

  

On Time, On Target!

Mantes is home to a stealthy insectoid predator that uses the water, fog, and mist to stalk its prey. The Mantes Mantid is the leading cause of death on world. 

The “Mantes Minutemen” were originally a militia-esque group that maintained law and order on the planet under Super Earth’s guidance, and would band together whenever  Mantes Mantid nests or breeding grounds were found to eliminate the threat to the local populace. When the vile Automatons first invaded, the Mantes Minutemen held the line until the first wave of Helldivers made it to the world, those same Helldivers would take on the mantle and name of Mantes Minutemen in honor of those who fought so valiantly, those who joined the Ranks of divers defending the planet,  and as a promise to forever defend Liberty & Democracy across the Galaxy!![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-SWm59gfUPq3SxfC59hYkQK1JwGC4MKWPHN066ZtLPYvyExce3XMXlh6puKw6x6tzWPOWY8c51-Kyyv1Thk7_TF6tAbJQ3AZrCv-H4UnTW_U4Cw_JZqc1_dpgGApwaM6NjZaZbuoSbuSjvf75je_uA)
