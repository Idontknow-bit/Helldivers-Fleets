┃Notable comments:
┃Despite being a wonderful soldier, and exemplary demolition woman, and possessing a real knack for hitting the bots where it hurts,
┃Ivara will never hold an official rank higher than Captain. This is due to the "Third Siege" incident on Mantes. Under normal coniditions,
┃a soldier would be executed for the actions Ivara took. However, SEV does not ignore results. This is what she had to say regarding the incident.
┃
┃(Redacted): Are you aware of the charges you're facing captain?
┃
┃Ivara: Byeahg, (sound of liquid impacting interrogation table) I know. 
┃
┃(Redacted): Super Christ! What is that?
┃
┃Ivara: Did you know automatons have hearts? Its true. I ran out of ammo before you lads picked me up. And mind you I had some troopers yet to kill...
┃
┃(Redacted): Thats... a heart?
┃
┃Ivara: Yeah... Im glad I have my titanium crown implants yaknow? I pinned down a trooper after disarming it. Had to chew through its neck pumps to get it to stop moving.
┃
┃(Redacted): You... You can't be serious.
┃
┃Ivara: I am. Once you called the order to pull out I just... couldn't. Yaknow? This is my home. I couldn't leave it. I stayed. 
┃ I fought. Kept fighting. I had to grave-rob hellpods yaknow, just to have enough ammunition to last until you lads came back. 
┃I kept working. While you were out doing who knows what, I remained. Yes, I ignored orders. Go on then, string me up. But you've seen my handiwork while you've been gone
┃ Orders.... Orders be damn-
