Name:[LOST FROM RECORDS] 
Helldiver Callsign: Bratko 
Rank: Death Captain 
Home planet: Mantes 
Unit: Mantes Minutemen 
Commanding officer: Commander Zero 
Role: Anti Infantry, Heavy support 

Specializations: Hand to hand combat 
Attritional warfare 
Explosives expert 

Service record: Several deployments on the western front in both liberation and defensive campaigns. Fought in the defense of Mantes, got commemorated for leading a certain death charge against the bots. According to reports both helldiver Bratko and helldiver Vanakae became surrounded by bots and as a last ditch effort mounted tactical gators and charged the enemy. Both gators were later reported K.I.A but their sacrifices were not in vain as the charge lead to both helldivers being able to link up with the rest of the minutemen and continue the fight. Fought several more campaigns but sadly the reports are still not finished and therefore cannot be summarized. 

Commemorations: Was awarded the Gator Fang of valour for his actions alongside helldiver Vanakae on Mantes. Recently awarded Mantid Scale of service, a greenish hued medal with a dangerous mantid scale embedded into it and given to each Helldiver for their service over a period of time. Transgressions: Aggravated assault against fellow helldiver Theft of stimulants from F.E.A.R officers Manslaughter Notes from [REDACTED] The helldiver known as Bratko has shown expertise in guerilla and attritional operations, though having a service record that is hardly anything special he has still proven himself to be a valued asset. He has managed to reach the rank of Death captain but any other attempts at promotion have been denied by high command for his previous transgressions and for the fact Bratko has failed his yearly psych evaluation twice now. High command is looking in to a potential relocation to S.C.A.R. [END OF FILE]
