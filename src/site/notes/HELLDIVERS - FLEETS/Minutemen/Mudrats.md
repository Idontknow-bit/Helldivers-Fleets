## Lore
The planet Mantes was a desolate wasteland, its once lush forests now reduced to twisted metal and scorched earth. The air hung heavy with the acrid stench of burning circuits and the distant hum of robotic sentinels. 
Six soldiers, their armor battered and spirits worn thin, trudged through the muck of the marshlands. 
Their mission: to reclaim a settlement overrun by relentless machines. 
Private Sam Lincolnshire, the youngest of the squad, clutched his rifle with white-knuckled determination. His eyes darted from one murky pool to another, expecting the next metallic monstrosity to emerge. Sam had seen too much death already—the screams of fallen comrades echoing in his nightmares. 

Corporal Matt Carter, grizzled and scarred, led the way. 
His cybernetic eye scanned the horizon, calculating trajectories and assessing threats. 
Matt’s left arm was a patchwork of wires and synthetic muscle, a testament to battles fought and lost. He’d seen too many friends torn apart by the relentless onslaught of the robots. 
Heavy Gunner Shian Mienna, her exosuit groaning under the weight of the minigun, trudged alongside Matt. 

Shian was a force of nature—a woman who laughed in the face of danger. 
Her helmet bore the tally marks of fallen enemies, etched with grim satisfaction. But even she couldn’t shake the creeping dread that clung to the marshlands like a shroud. 

Radioman Misha Reign stumbled, his communication gear crackling with static. Misha was the heart of the squad, the one who kept them connected when all else failed. His fingers danced across the console, relaying coordinates and desperate pleas for reinforcements. But the radio waves were silent, swallowed by the relentless interference of the robots. 

Sergeant Henry Bullets, grizzled and battle-hardened, marched at the rear. His face was etched with lines of sorrow and determination. Henry had lost too many friends—their names etched into the metal plate on his chest. He carried their memories like a burden, each step is a tribute to their sacrifice. 

Lieutenant Kendrick Hannocks, the strategist. Kendrick’s mind was a steel trap, analyzing every move, every possibility. But even he couldn’t predict the desperation that clung to their mission. His orders were clear: reclaim the settlement, no matter the cost.
As they slogged through the marshlands, the ground quaked beneath their boots. The robots were closing in, their mechanical eyes glinting in the murky twilight. 

The squad moved as one, their weapons trained on the horizon. But hope was a distant memory—a flicker of light swallowed by the encroaching darkness. And then it happened. 
A barrage of laser fire erupted from the reeds, cutting down Shian and Misha. 
Sam screamed, his rifle shaking in his hands. Matt dragged him behind a fallen tree, returning fire with deadly precision. 
But the robots kept coming, their numbers inexhaustible. Kendrick fell next, a burst of energy tearing through his chest. 
His last words echoed in the swampy air: “Finish the mission.” And so they did. 
Sam, Matt, and Henry fought like demons, their bodies battered and broken. The settlement loomed ahead—a crumbling ruin, its walls breached and its people long gone. 
But they pressed on, driven by duty and desperation. 

In the end, it was only Sergeant Henry Bullets who staggered through the gates. His armor was scorched, his heart heavy with grief. He collapsed in the center of the settlement, surrounded by the ghosts of fallen comrades. The robots had won, but Henry had reclaimed something more precious: a memory of home, of laughter and camaraderie. As the marshlands swallowed the settlement once more, Henry whispered their names—the fallen soldiers who had fought alongside him. And then he closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. When word reached command, a strike team was made after them. "Ex limo surgimus. Ad libertatem petimus. - From the mud we rise. To liberty we march."
