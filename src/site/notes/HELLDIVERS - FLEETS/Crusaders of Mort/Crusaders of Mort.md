## Lore
When the automaton socialists began their cowardly invasion of our home planet Mort, the Ministry of War had the foresight to know that brave Morticians on the planet would take up the call to defend their posterity. 

The Crusaders of Mort was activated on Februrary 25, 2224 and strives to be the main force that drives the robotic scum of the Xzar Sector. 

The Crusaders of Mort believe in completing the mission at any cost. Our planet has a large, freedom-loving population that is more than willing to lay their lives down for managed democracy. The Crusaders currently boast a 100% mission completion rate and a 48% extraction rate. 

Save your family from the clanker threat today! 
Remember the Creek
