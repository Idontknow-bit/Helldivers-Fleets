`Service Record, from the Ministry of Truth:`
Although no longer in the field due to his position and rank, Sigyl Gardner served as an administrator for the local Hellmire regiment of the S.E.A.F until he committed numerous anti-democratic crimes. For his punishment, he was sent to a reeducation camp where he was determined to be resistant to usual democratizing measures. For his own liberty, he was sent to a minor penal battalion and pushed into the front lines against rebellions and dissidents.

He survived for far longer than anyone thought he would, and was put in charge of that battalion, which he dissolved and reformed into VICE as it is today. He oversees the majority of VICE operations, and is known for leading with a ruthless strategy and combat doctrine of brutal orbital bombardments and prodigious use of energy weaponry.
